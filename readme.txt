Quick utility to get IP location.  Currently all sources are displayed, but future update will include switches to choose any/all sources.  Not a priority as this is a piece of a bigger project.  It will get added just cuz fun.


Planed Updates: In order of priority.
  Add more sources.  
  Error checking for goofy ip locations like 192.168.1.1 (Currently fails when doing this)
  Switches to choose sources.
